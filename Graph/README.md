Comparison between `ArangoDB`, `Memgraph`, `Neo4J` and `Dgraph`, all the steps I took to compare these in the most concise way and why I've chosen `Dgraph` to be my tool of choice.

## Abstract

How to choose Graph database that suits your Go app needs? Let's talk how I've approached this problem and how my findings might help your judgement!

## Elevator pitch:

Graph databases are with us from mid-1960s, but in the recent years, they've grew to be the next-big-thing. But what they actually achieve?
My talk with follow you through the journey of choosing a graph database for your next Go application and will show you, that googling `Best Graph Database` doesn't always returns the best candidate for Go world. Same as googling `Best James Bond`.
By the time the conference is over, you will know all the pros and cons of few major graphdb players, how these things will affect your application and how to write your first Graph queries!
